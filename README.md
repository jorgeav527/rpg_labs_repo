## Project Description

**What it does?** ðŸ’¡ It's a Web Application for Testing Services at a Civil Engineering Laboratory. **Why did you build this project?** ðŸ’¡ It will be used not only to put together the business's logistics but also to automate in real-time the logic behind some of the most used lab tests in the civil engineering career.

**What was my motivation?** ðŸ’¡ This is built on top of my thesis project, so I'll implement some new UX/UI features and make an upgrade to the project architecture. I will create a package for extending and scaling the implemented tests, this will be updated and maintained on a different repo. **What did you learn?** ðŸ’¡ The focus of this project is to create a Data-WareHouse to extract and create some nice Dashboards to give some insides about the characteristics of the tests and business financials.

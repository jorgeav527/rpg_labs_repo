## Project Description

**What it does?** ðŸ’¡ It's a Web Application for Testing Services at a Civil Engineering Laboratory. **Why did you build this project?** ðŸ’¡ It will be used not only to put together the business's logistics but also to automate in real-time the logic behind some of the most used lab tests in the civil engineering career.

**What was my motivation?** ðŸ’¡ This is built on top of my thesis project, so I'll implement some new UX/UI features and make an upgrade to the project architecture. I will create a package for extending and scaling the implemented tests, this will be updated and maintained on a different repo. **What did you learn?** ðŸ’¡ The focus of this project is to create a Data-WareHouse to extract and create some nice Dashboards to give some insides about the characteristics of the tests and business financials.

## Parts of the Project

### 1. Price Quotations

#### **UX/UI design**

The design of this Web Application is made with [NiceAdmin v2.2.2](https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/) for a beautiful, simple, and responsive UI. I'm using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [django-htmx](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx) because there is no need to add a full React or Vue for the UX frontend. The final product is what the company expected and more. 

#### **Adding test for the quotations**

First, I design a logic in Django's backend admin to introduce the cost of each test and implement a way to add to the price the related tests, like if a parent main test could have many children tests. For an easy and fast CSV data import, I use [django-import-export](https://django-import-export.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This is how to add child test:

And this a parent test:

And how to add child test to a parent test:

Notice that when you save the parent test, the total price will be automatically calculated:

#### **Company registrations**

This is where an admin user will enroll companies by filling out the following form:

Because it is made with HTMX the experience is full responsive:

#### **Enployee and Project registrations**

Someone of the staff of the company must be enrolled:

And it is also required to provide the name and location of the project:

#### **Generate the requirements**

The pre-requirement order has the primary data. We can fill the company with all of its employees and projects. We can input a discount, the type of service, and the documents it will generate; by default, it will create the quotation and the requirement:

In the next part, the app is capable to add as many tests as we want; we just have to introduce the lab and the test.Â  It will pull the data from the admin panel and be ready for use.

The last part of the form is to add the payment conditions, which indicates how the total cost will be divided into parts.

As soon as we save the form. A detailed total bill will be calculated and there are two documents to be found. As we advance into the order requirement it will show 4 documents.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Localy

* Build and up the conteirner

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
    ```

* If you want to verify the content of the staticfiles
    
    ```bash
    mkdir data/web
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py collectstatic --no-input"
    ```

* Make migrations or get inside the docker postgres 

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app python manage.py makemigrations
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app python manage.py migrate
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml exec db psql --username=devuser --dbname=devddb
    ```

* Create a superuser or enter to the shell
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app python manage.py createsuperuser
    docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm app python manage.py shell
    ```

### 2. Deploy

* I'm going to use an instance in Linode
* For deploy just pull the code to Linode instance
* Run the docker-compose-prod.yml file
